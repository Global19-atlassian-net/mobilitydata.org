      <h2>Travelers need mobility apps.</h2>
      <h2>Mobility apps need high-quality data.</h2>
      <p>Data is fundamental to realizing mobility as a service — providing travelers convenient means of discovering, accessing, and paying for mobility services. MobilityData improves data formats that make useful apps possible.</p>

      <h3>Our goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Broaden adoption of standardized formats so mobility data is available throughout the world.</li>
        <li>Increase completeness of data formats so that more service features can be represented in apps.</li>
        <li>Enhance the accuracy and quality of data to ensure that the information travelers see in an app matches the real world.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h3>How we are doing this</h3>
      <p>MobilityData builds on and accelerates existing successes with the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS, including its real-time extensions) and other mobility data formats.</p>

      <p>GTFS governance follows a bottom-up model. The organizations producing and consuming data drive the addition of specification features. To adopt a new feature, it has to first be tested in software, ensuring that new features are practical and grounded in real use cases.</p>

      <p>The grassroots governance model ensures buy in for new features. MobilityData sustains this model — and accelerates the process to keep pace with mobility industry needs. MobilityData provides facilitation and leadership to enhance specifications through existing technical communities, building off Rocky Mountain Institute’s <a href="http://gtfs.org/best-practices/">GTFS Best Practices</a> project.</p>

      <h3>Our work</h3>
      <p>MobilityData’s planned first year of work focuses exclusively on improving schedule and real-time public transit data. In future years, MobilityData aims to improve data for other functions and modes.</p>

      <p>Planned through July 2019:</p>

      <p>Community management: The MobilityData team is curating existing proposals to change GTFS, and field new incoming questions and proposals.</p>

      <p>Make GTFS more clear: Resolve known issues and inconsistencies in GTFS, publish how-to guides for GTFS, and update <a href="http://gtfs.org/best-practices/">GTFS Best Practices</a>, adding real-time.</p>

      <p>Add features to GTFS to describe more transit services and features:
        <ul>
          <li>Demand-responsive transit (DRT)</li>
        	<li>Unplanned service changes, such as detours or replacement shuttles</li>
        	<li>Vehicle and station facility features for step-free accessible transit</li>
        	<li>Fare structures and travel restrictions</li>
        	<li>Line & service, and operator names (branding)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Make industry practices and research on transit data easier to discover, including:
        <ul>
        	<li>Benefits of real-time information</li>
        	<li>Transit data libraries and tools</li>
        	<li>Data practices throughout the world</li>
        </ul>
